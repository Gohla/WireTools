# Wire Tools

Adds shortcuts (the buttons to the right of the quickbar) for managing wires:

- *Power grid isolator*: Marks power poles and isolates their power grid by disconnecting all copper cables between poles in the selected area and poles outside of the selected area. Does not disconnect wires connected to power switches. Does not disconnect circuit wires. Default hotkey: Alt + G

**NOTE:** There is no undo for disconnecting wires, so be careful!
